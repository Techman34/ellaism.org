## Development

* A new client, called [multi-geth](https://github.com/ellaism/multi-geth), is developed. This is a go-ethereum client that supports multiple networks, including Ethereum and Ellaism, and we are working on Ethereum Classic support.
* [Ellaism Explorer](https://explorer.ellaism.org) is integrated with [ENS](https://ens.ellaism.org), [Rich List](https://explorer.ellaism.org/accounts), and [Miner Rank](https://explorer.ellaism.org/miners).
* Our new Discord server is tightly intergrated with our blockchain, with most of the audit logs available as Ethereum logs. This includes [working group logs](0x5feab2d9547654db3c86db6d7f0529f246c16548), [moderation logs](0x54d4f521f1d51cce3b990611d677d47ad4f69a49), as well as [enthusiasts](0x69808D56a15A4465F898Fd61a8a54beb24788Eb0), [regulars](0x05d12A005524Db8791A25C61B884eAD293a12F2a), [developers](0x619bf2a5eeb88efe54d93dedd263688582e10f24) and [moderators](0x3f54c8e9f0623367557ea0946d9f854a451c8669) joining and leaving logs.
