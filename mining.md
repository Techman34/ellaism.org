title: Mining Ellaism
---

Ellaism uses the *ethash* proof of work algorithm, the same algorithm used in
Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.

## Solo Mining

Follow the guide in [Installation](/install/) to either set up a Parity or Geth
full node. After that, you can use any ethash miner (such as
[ethminer](https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer)) to mine Ellasim. To
mine using your GPU, run `ethminer -G -F http://localhost:8545`.

## Pools

Please try solo mining first! At this stage, it's more profitable and helps the
network decentralization. If solo mining is not an option, you can use the
mining pools below. Help is appreciated to keep the [Dev Mining
Pool](https://pool.ellaism.org) running. This pool maintains several
infrastructures on Ellaism, like the BTC Relay fetchd script, and contributes
directly to the [Dev Fund](http://ellaism.org/donations/).

You can also find a more updated mining pool list at
[Minerpool](https://minerpool.net/pools/ellaism/). Pools have their own
instructions of how to set your miners up.
