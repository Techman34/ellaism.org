# How to use the twitter faucet.

- Ellaism has a Twitter faucet to help new users get started with the network. 
- By tweeting anything with tag $ELLA, you can claim a small amount of money. 

- First, get your Tweet ID, with a url like `https://twitter.com/ellaismcore/status/958926185991254016` the Tweet ID is the digits in the end `958926185991254016`. 

- Then, go to the Ellaism discord. In `#ask-ella-bot` channel, send a message `!faucet claim <tweet id> <destination address>`. 

- For example, `!faucet claim 958926462907658241 0xe9C2d958E6234c862b4AfBD75b2fd241E9556303`. The bot will then send you 1/2000 of the current balance in faucet, or 0.1 ELLA, whichever is lower. 

- If you want to donate to the faucet, the address is
[0x231ea5595788f704522c630a22c0b7cc49318ef6](https://explorer.ellaism.org/addr/0x231ea5595788f704522c630a22c0b7cc49318ef6).

Special thanks to [TBates](https://keybase.io/tbates76) and [Buzzkillb](https://keybase.io/buzzkillb) for the initial donations that made the faucet possible. And [Dev Pool](https://pool.ellaism.org) sponsors the transaction fees.
