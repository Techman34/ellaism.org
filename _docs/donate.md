Ellaism didn't have an ICO and is a coin without a pre-mine. Donations are welcomed to keep those that contributed to the coin rewarded. This page was set up so that you can donate to some people who have contributed code either directly or indirectly to Ellaism.

## Dev Fund

The Dev Fund [0xe9C2d958E6234c862b4AfBD75b2fd241E9556303](https://explorer.ellaism.org/addr/0xe9C2d958E6234c862b4AfBD75b2fd241E9556303) is a multisig wallet used to set up the core development team, operate infrastructures of Ellaism, and support other development activities related to the Ellaism blockchain.
