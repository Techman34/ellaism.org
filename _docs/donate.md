Ellaism didn't have an ICO and is a coin without a pre-mine. Donations are welcomed to keep those that contributed to the coin rewarded. This page was set up so that you can donate to some people who have contributed code either directly or indirectly to Ellaism.

## Dev Fund

The Dev Fund [0xe9C2d958E6234c862b4AfBD75b2fd241E9556303](https://explorer.ellaism.org/addr/0xe9C2d958E6234c862b4AfBD75b2fd241E9556303) is a multisig wallet used to set up the core development team, operate infrastructures of Ellaism, and support other development activities related to the Ellaism blockchain. You can find the current signer information, deployment details and instructions for verifying the proof from [this document](https://github.com/ellaism/meta/tree/master/multisig). [Financial reports](https://github.com/ellaism/meta/tree/master/finance) are published every month for transparency. You can learn more about the role which Dev Fund and Ellaism Core plays in the whole Ellaism community from the [roadmap](https://ellaism.org/roadmap). Currently the fund is used for:

* Development of Ellaism [geth](https://github.com/ellaism/go-ellaism) and support for [Parity client](https://github.com/ellaism/parity-config).
* Ellaism explorer.
* Ellaism public JSON-RPC API.
* BTC Relay.
